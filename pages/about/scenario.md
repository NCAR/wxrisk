title: Hurricane Scenario

# Introduction #

The following scenario is provided as a thought exercise about what type of information people need to make critical decisions during a hurricane landfall event. 
This scenario is one that many coastal residents are all-too familiar with. 

## Scenario 1 ##

Imagine you live in a house in Melbourne Beach, Florida, a community on a barrier island about halfway up the east coast of the state between Miami and Jacksonville. 
You are married and have a 3-year old toddler and two dogs. You live in a typical one story wood frame house about a quarter mile inland from the beach.
You have two cars and an emergency fund with $2000 in it, but your family is somewhat strapped for cash at the moment. 

### Tuesday ###

A tropical storm has formed and is forecast to approach your area in 5 days. You feel some concern and go to the National Hurricane Center web page and see this:

### Wednesday ###

The next day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast shows a similar track toward your area, but now the storm is forecast to be a hurricane by landfall about four days from now.

Some of the hurricane forecast models show that the storm could be a major hurricane. The media coverage is already extensive and there are reports about people flocking to stores to buy plywood, batteries, and bottled water. You swing by the grocery store on the way home to get a few items to refresh your hurricane preparation kit. The bottled water is already sold out, but you're able to get some batteries and canned food. At supper that night, you start discussing with your family what your plan will be if the storm stays on track. Your partner is the adventurous type and wants to stay and ride it out, but you are not so sure. You are more risk-averse.   

### Thursday ###

The next morning, the NHC forecast graphic shows the dreaded 'M' right off the coast from Melbourne -- a Major Hurricane, with the track plowing straight into central Florida.

This is starting to feel like it could be "The Big One". You check your Twitter feed and see some weather enthusiasts posting scary screenshots of numerical model output of 145 mph winds over your area. You call your mom in Savannah, GA to see if it might be possible to stay with her if you and your family need to evacuate. She says "sure, come on up!", but you know your partner will need some convincing. Your neighbors are already putting up their storm shutters, but you have the type that require professional installation which would cost $500. You agonize whether you should call to schedule the installers to come, wondering when might be too late. That night, you and your partner have a heated discussion over what your family should do. You

### Friday ###

You wake up the next morning and immediately check the NHC web page. Now you see this:

The storm has rapidly intensified, but the forecast track has slowed considerably and is now predicted to make landfall a little bit further south from your area. The "cone of uncertainty" covers nearly all of Florida, however. Suprisingly, landfall now looks to still be four days out. The NHC key message includes "Life-threatening storm surge and devastating hurricane-force winds are likely along portions of the Florida east coast by early next week, but it is too soon to determine where the highest storm
surge and winds will occur. Residents should have their hurricane plan in place, know if they are in a hurricane evacuation zone, and listen to advice given by local emergency officials." You think to yourself "someone is going to really get it, but they just don't know who yet".

The new track has you feeling a little relieved, but you know that if the storm follows the new track, you would still be in line to get some serious affects. You also keep hearing the TV weathercaster saying not to focus on the exact track. You and your partner are the type of people who like to be prepared, so you have decided to put up your storm shutters. You call the company and they have you booked for the next day. You've also decided that if the storm stays on track, you will evacuate to your mom's house, probably leaving by mid-day Sunday.  

That evening, you see a blurb flash across the screen that the storm is now a Category 4 hurricane. Before going to bed, you check the latest forecast and now see that the storm is forecast to track nearly directly over your area, but then skirt up the coast directly toward Savannah. You scramble to think of other evacuation options. You see that you can get a hotel in Naples for $150/night or one in Tampa for $120/night. You have a really uneasy feeling about your situation, but you finally fall asleep. 

### Saturday ###

You 

You are worried about traffic. Google Maps already shows that I-95 has heavy traffic all the way to the Jacksonville. That evening you hear that aircraft reconnaissance data suggests that the storm may be starting to rapidly intensifying.



nearing hurricane intensity and news about preparations are all over the media. The model guidance shows some scenarios with the storm making landfall in your area, but there's also another cluster of tracks that recurve the storm out to sea.
