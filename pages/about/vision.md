## Vision ##

Providing localized and personalized risk information to save lives and reduce property damage to all people affected by hurricanes and tropical cyclones.

## Scenario ##

The following scenario is all-too familiar to many coastal residents. Imagine you live in a house in Melbourne, Florida, about halfway up the east coast of the state between Miami and Jacksonville. You are married and have a 3-year old toddler and two dogs. You live in a typical single-story woodframe house about a half mile inland from the beach.

### Tuesday ###

A tropical storm has formed and is forecast to approach your area in 5 days. You feel some concern and go to the National Hurricane Center web page and see this:

### Wednesday ###

The next day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast shows a similar track toward your area, but now the storm is forecast to be a hurricane by landfall about four days from now.

Some of the hurricane forecast models show that the storm could be a major hurricane. The media coverage is already extensive and there are reports about people flocking to stores to buy plywood, batteries, and bottled water. You swing by the grocery store on the way home to get a few items to refresh your hurricane preparation kit. The bottled water is already sold out, but you're able to get some batteries and canned food. At supper that night, you start discussing with your family what your plan will be if the storm stays on track. Your partner wants to stay and ride it out, but you are not so sure.   

### Thursday ###

The next morning, the NHC forecast graphic shows the dreaded 'M' right off the coast from Melbourne -- Major Hurricane, with a track continuing into central Florida.

This is starting to feel like "The Big One". You check your Twitter feed and see some weather enthusiasts posting scary screenshots of numerical model output showing 140 mph winds over your area. You call your mom in Savannah, GA to see if it might be possible to stay with her if you and your family need to evacuate. Your neighbors are already putting up their storm shutters, but you have the type that require professional installation that costs $500. You agonize whether you should call to schedule the installers to come, wondering when might be too late.

### Friday ###

nearing hurricane intensity and news about preparations are all over the media. The model guidance shows some scenarios with the storm making landfall in your area, but there's also another cluster of tracks that recurve the storm out to sea.
