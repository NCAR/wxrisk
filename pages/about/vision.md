## Vision ##

Providing localized and personalized risk information to save lives and reduce property damage to all people affected by hurricanes and tropical cyclones.

### Scenario ###

The following is all-too familiar to many coastal residents. 

A tropical storm has formed and is forecast to approach your area in 5 days. You feel some concern and go to the National Hurricane Center web page and see this:



The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm could be a major hurricane by that time. By the next day, the storm is nearing hurricane intensity and news about preparations are all over the media. The model guidance shows some scenarios with the storm making landfall in your area, but there's also another cluster of tracks that recurve the storm out to sea.
