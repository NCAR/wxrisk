## Project Updates ##

### 16 September 2020 ###

We have added the capability to retrieve pointwise wind output into the web app. To our knowledge, this is the first of its kind capability for any web site. The first retrieval, shown below, was
for Pensacola Naval Air Station, which was in the process of being impacted by Hurricane Sally.

We have added multiple address capability into the web app. 
Previously, the app could only store one address at a time and the ResRe cyclone resilience score was tied directly to the user's id. 
Now, the app will let a user define up to 10 separate addresses and fill out a ResRe vulnerable profile for each location. 
The ResRe resilience score is now tied to the property id itself. 
This important change allows users to examine their risk at multiple locations. This will eventually support new capability to allow users to share their risk outputs with each other.

### 25 January 2021 ###

We have updated the web app to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) required by the European Union. 
This includes allowing a user to delete their account and all personal information (e.g., email, address). The web app retains a record that the user's information has been deleted to comply with GDPR.
