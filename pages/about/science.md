## Our Science

### Vision ###

To provide localized and personalized risk information to all people affected by hurricanes and tropical cyclones for the purpose of saving lives and reducing property damage.

### How we will achieve this vision ###

The HurricaneRiskCalculator&reg; web app is a public-facing decision support tool based on a probabilistic risk framework that intersects real-time tropical cyclone wind hazard predictions with a structural vulnerability model. Through this intersection of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure, the tool calculates the risks of various consequences, such as different degrees of structural damage and whether the structure will be habitable following the tropical cyclone.

When a user first registers with the web app, the tool directs them to our partners, ResilientResidence (ResRe) and James Cook University, to take a guided structural vulnerability assessment questionnaire about the attributes of their residence. ResRe uses expert engineering judgment to compute a Cyclone Resilience Score. The web app then uses this resilience score to intersect the user’s structural vulnerability with the predicted probabilistic wind hazard for the user’s location (geolocated from the user’s provided address). This allows the tool to provide actionable information about potential tropical cyclone impacts at a user’s specific location and structure and then contextualize the potential risks into easily understandable forms to guide effective evacuation decisions and optimize the timing of other protective actions. The combination of structural vulnerability information with real-time wind hazard prediction via a probabilistic risk framework provides a powerful means of providing decision support that considers the various sources of uncertainty in the predicted tropical cyclone wind hazard and the underlying uncertainty about the structural vulnerability of the asset itself. 

To bring in the relevant expertise needed for a transdisciplinary project like this, a “Researcher Collective” was established in 2019, comprised of 39 experts spanning the disciplines of meteorology, numerical and geophysical modeling, verification, structural engineering, cloud computing, user design and user experience, social science, utility modeling, storm surge modeling, cognitive psychology, emergency management, and human vulnerability.
