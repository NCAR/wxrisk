## Sign Up for Project Updates

We will send periodic updates about the project to all who are interested. The frequency of e-mails will normally be monthly, but we may send an extra e-mail when there is a significant development in the project.

We will soon have a snazzy sign-up form to allow you to join the distribution list. For now, if you'd like to sign up to receive these e-mails, please send an e-mail to [riskcalculator@ucar.edu](mailto:riskcalculator@ucar.edu&subject=sign-up%20for%20project%20updates).
