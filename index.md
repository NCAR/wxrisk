banner-title: The Hurricane Risk Calculator (TM)
banner-description: The goal of the HurricaneRiskCalculatorTM is to provide a localized and personalized assessment of the risks posed by hurricane winds and then to translate this into a form that people can use to make informed decisions about preparation and evacuation. This project is building a cloud-based data and content delivery infrastructure to support a wide range of mobile apps built around the new probabilistic risk framework of the HurricaneRiskCalculatorTM.

![Image of output from the Hurricane Risk Calculator simulated as being displayed on a mobile phone screen. This image shows a comparison of the risks of various options rangding from sheltering in place to evacuating to a local shelter to evacuating to a distant location. Because evacuation by car also poses risks, the best option for this scenario would be for the resident to evacuate to a local shelter.](<img src="/images/risk_comparison.png" alt="" style="display: block;margin: auto;">)
