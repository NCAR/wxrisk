banner-description: The goal of the HurricaneRiskCalculator&reg; web app is to provide a localized and personalized assessment of the risks posed by hurricane winds and then to translate this into a form that people can use to make informed decisions about preparation and evacuation. This project is building a cloud-based data and content delivery infrastructure to support a wide range of mobile apps built around the new probabilistic risk framework of the HurricaneRiskCalculator&reg;.

This image shows a comparison of the risks of various options rangding from sheltering in place to evacuating to a local shelter to evacuating to a distant location. Because evacuation by car also poses risks, the best option for this scenario would be for the resident to evacuate to a local shelter." style="display: block; margin: auto;">
