banner-description: The goal of the HurricaneRiskCalculator&reg; web app is to provide a localized and personalized assessment of the risks posed by hurricane winds and then to translate this into a form that people can use to make informed decisions about their hurricane preparations. The HurricaneRiskCalculator&reg; web app will be pilot testing in the U.S. and Australia in 2021. To be notified when the web app is available, please [Sign-up here](https://groups.google.com/a/ucar.edu/forum/#!forum/riskcalculator-updates/join)

Because evacuation by car also poses risks, the best option for this scenario would be for the resident to evacuate to a local shelter." style="display: block; margin: auto;"> -->
