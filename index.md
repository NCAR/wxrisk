banner-description: The goal of the HurricaneRiskCalculatorTM is to provide a localized and personalized assessment of the risks posed by hurricane winds and then to translate this into a form that people can use to make informed decisions about preparation and evacuation. This project is building a cloud-based data and content delivery infrastructure to support a wide range of mobile apps built around the new probabilistic risk framework of the HurricaneRiskCalculatorTM.
